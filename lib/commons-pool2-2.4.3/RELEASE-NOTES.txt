              Apache Commons Pool 2.4.3 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Pool team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons Pool 2.4.3.

Apache Commons Pool provides an object-pooling API and a number of object pool implementations.
Version 2 contains a completely re-written pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.
In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance
tracking and pool monitoring. Version 2 requires JDK level 1.6 or above. 

No client code changes are required to migrate from versions 2.0-2.3 to version 2.4.3.
Users of version 1.x should consult the migration guide on the Commons Pool web site.

NOTE: The MBean interfaces (DefaultPooledObjectInfoMBean, GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean
      and GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean) exist only to define the attributes and methods
      that will be made available via JMX. They must not be implemented by clients as
      they are subject to change between major, minor and patch version releases of
      Commons Pool. Clients that implement any of these interfaces may not, therefore,
      be able to upgrade to a new minor or patch release without requiring code
      changes.

Changes in version 2.4.3 include:

New features:
o POOL-320:  Use more efficient stack walking mechanisms for usage tracking when possible.

Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-328:  Documentation with repeated words (sources, tests, and examples). Thanks to Lorenzo Solano Martinez.
o POOL-317:  Correction of default value of softMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis in BaseObjectPoolConfig. Thanks to KeiichiFujino.
o POOL-309:  Fix misspellings from "destory" to "destroy". Thanks to jolestar, Roopam Patekar.
o POOL-306:  Ensure BaseGenericObjectPool.IdentityWrapper#equals() follows the expected
             contract for equals(). Thanks to Adrian Crum.
o POOL-303:  Ensure that threads do not block indefinitely if more than maxTotal
             threads try to borrow an object at the same time and the factory fails to
             create any objects.
o POOL-310:  Ensure that threads using GKOP do not block indefinitely if more than
             maxTotal threads try to borrow objects with different keys at the same
             time and the factory destroys objects on return. Thanks to Ivan Iliev.
o            Ensure that any class name used for evictionPolicyClassName represents a
             class that implements EvictionPolicy.
o POOL-315:  Add a configurable delay (default 10 seconds) to wait when shutting down
             an Evictor to allow the associated thread time to complete and current
             evictions and to terminate. Thanks to KeiichiFujino.
o            Ensure that a call to GKOP preparePool() takes account of other threads
             that might create objects concurrently, particularly the Evictor.

Changes:
o POOL-280:  Small refactoring of borrowObject() to reduce code duplication. Thanks to Jacopo Cappellato.
o POOL-307:  Replace inefficient use of keySet with entrySet in GKOP. Thanks to Anthony Whitford.
o POOL-322:  Update optional cglib library from 3.1 to 3.2.5.
o POOL-323:  Update optional OW2 ASM from 5.0.4 to 5.2.
